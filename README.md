# FIRST
MY STORY,

My full name is Nouh Ali Omar, I’m 20 years old, I'm a full stack web developer and passionate about education, technology and personal development.

Every day I dedicate my time to learning more and getting closer to my goal. I’ve learned HTML, CSS, Javascript - React, NodeJS, Ruby on Rails and a lot of other stuff. But more importantly, I’ve been learning how to have discipline not to give up when things get complicated and that I really like to program. :)

One of the best ways to stay motivated is to connect with people with the same passion, so this will be a place to share all my experiences and thoughts with you and to encourage other women to learn how to program as well - but everyone can benefit from knowledge.

I hope you join me on this journey! We Can Do It! 💪
